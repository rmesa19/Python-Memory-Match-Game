I went the objects/class route for the final project.
I simply thought it would be alot more convenient when 
having to combine variable work and pass in functions
with click functionality.  It was the only way I saw I could combine
everything I needed. The design provded easy access to my variables.

My approach to testing was very hands on. as soon as I encountered a problem
as I was coding, I looked to resolve the issue. I tried my best to be as accurate as 
possible the first go around. Through trial and erroe I decided to implement a turtle array
to provide different sources for the writing and have them all in one place.
multiple turtles made my animation much quicker and easier to maintain.

Additionally, I created my click function in my main which allowed me to pass in coordinate
arguments as well as pass in the variables I needed located in the game_class StatusBox. 

Classes created:
	StatusBox: used as a convinient way to handle necessary 
		  variables all in one location. And because it is a class,
		  it can be passed into other functions and provide access to
		  to necessary variable inside of it)
	  Attributes
		-window
		-player_name
		-game_size
		-guess
		-match
		-flipped_index
		-turtle_bank
		-cardface_bank
		-settings_bank
		-gamecard_bank

	Card: used as a convinient was to represent a "card".
	  Attributes
		-turtle
		-front
		-back
		-flipped

Functions created:
	draw_leaderboard
	custom_images
	save_leaderboard
		-reverse_bubble_sort
	draw_match
	draw_guess
	create_quad
	build_board
	draw_status
	card_eval
	twocard_eval
		-update_guess
		-update_match
	update_match
	winner
	quitbutton
	place_cards
